This plugin was started using the tutorial available here:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/DLTK_IDE_Guide:Step_1_Skeleton

The required DLTK version to build this can be obtained from:
http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dltk/downloads

Use the Stable or Integration (R1.0)


Status: I have followed the tutorial up to the "Python interpreter" secion. Nothing so far seems to be happening but more needs to be added.
